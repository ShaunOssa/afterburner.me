          <p>Thanks for your interest in Afterburner! Here's how you can apply
          for our Fall 2014 pilot:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Come up with an iOS project you want help with. It should be relatively sizable, something that would take at least a few thousand lines of code.</li>
            <li>Complete the challenge described below and store your code in a GitHub repo.</li>
            <li>Send an email to <a href="mailto:application@afterburner.me">application@afterburner.me</a> with your name, project description and a link to your GitHub repo.</li>
          </ul>
          <div class="divider-grey"></div>
          <div class="sub-title" style="text-align: center">Movie Suggestion Challenge</div>
          <div class="space"></div>
          <p>Build an iOS app using the Rotten
          Tomatoes API that suggests a “good” movie based on previous movie
          ratings.</p>

          <p>Start by presenting the user a series of movies to rate. Once the
          user has rated a few movies, display a list of movies you think the
          user would like, based on their ratings.</p>

          <p>Details are up to you, but here are some things to think about:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>How will you decide which movies to present to the user to
            rate? How can you increase the probability that the user has
            actually seen that movie? What happens if they haven't seen the
            movie? Maybe some resources in the Rotten Tomatoes API can help you
            with this :)</li>

            <li>How many initial movies should the user rate before displaying
            suggestions? Do more ratings make for more accurate
            suggestions?</li>

            <li>How will you find suggested movies based on the rated movies?
            What if you tried different criteria, like same genre, directors,
            actors etc.? How would you allow the user to select which criteria
            to apply?</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Tips:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Balance your time between visuals and algorithmic functionality.</li>
            <li>Even if you don't finish, be sure to turn in what you have.</li>
